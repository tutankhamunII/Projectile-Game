# Projectile-Game
Simple game in C and ASCII chars that allows user to enter an angle and velocity to lunch a projectile and try to hit a table.
  The program starts by drawing a playing field box consists of '*', '|', and '-'. It will draw a table inside this box using '=' and '|' that will be randomly placed
  inside the box and has a random height from the base. 
  
  The use should input a velcoity and angle separated by space. Then the program will print the same playing field but with dots representing the projectile that was 
  calculated using equations and user input. 
  
  if the user hits the top of the table, the program ends and the user won, otherwise it will continue until the user hits the table. Every trial the program will print
  the old projectiles so the user can use them to adjust the input velcoity and angle to win.
